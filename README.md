# All Velospots in Biel

## Movitation

Since its introduction in Biel, the bike-sharing service Velospot only provided a paper and PDF map with all the spots. Their mobile app is rated two stars and doesn't work for the city of Biel. Spots are missing on Google Map and they don't display any map on [their website](https://www.velospot.ch/). From what I saw, it seems that they're building a [new website](https://www.velospot.info/). 

In the meantime, I build this map in literary under 1 hour. Data are coming from [geo.admin.ch](https://data.geo.admin.ch/ch.bfe.bikesharing/) und I used [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
